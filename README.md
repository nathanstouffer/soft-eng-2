Course work for Advanced Software Engineering (ESOF 422 at Montana State University)

Advanced Software Engineering came in three parts. We first discussed modeling at high level (ie metamodels), we then moved to testing techniques, and finished off the course discussing cloud computing.
Homeworks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were are all partner assignments. Kevin Browder and I were partners.
Subsequent homeworks (done by me) are on branch *nathan*
