\section*{Question 1}

In question 1, we are asked to give the RBML Structural Pattern Specifications for the Singleton, State, Iterator, and Visitor Pattern. In addition, we must provide a compliant UML example and a near-instance of each design pattern.

\subsection*{Singleton Pattern}

\section*{Question 3}

{\bf Part i.} 
What does it mean to state that RBML characterizes pattern instances? \\\\
If a RBML charactarizes a pattern, it means two things. First, it means that all instances of that pattern are compliant with the RBML. Second, it also means that all UML diagrams that are compliant with the RBML are actually an instance of that design pattern. This ensures that the set of UML diagrams that are compliant with the RBML consists of all instances of the design pattern and nothing else.
\newline

\noindent
{\bf Part ii.} 
What does it mean to say that RBML defines a specialization of UML at the M2 level? \\\\
For RBML to define a specialization of UML at the M2 level, it means that RBML restricts the UML meta-model to accept a smaller set of UML class diagrams, which are design patterns.
\newline

\noindent
{\bf Part iii.} 
Select one RBML model from your answers in question 1, and provide two examples of
operation templates with pre and post conditions. \\\\
We now give two operation templates for operations in the Iterator Design Pattern.

\begin{Verbatim}
context |ConcreteContainer::|HasNext(): |Boolean
pre: true
post: result = self.|IsNull(self.|Index@pre + 1)
		
context |ConcreteContainer::Next(): |DataType
pre: self.|HasNext()
post: result = self.|Get(self.|Index@pre + 1)
		and self.|Index = self.|Index@pre + 1
\end{Verbatim}
